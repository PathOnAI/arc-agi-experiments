    "feedback": "Let's analyze your solution based on the provided visualizations.\n\n### Pattern Recognition\n\n**Positive Aspects:**\n- Your code correctly identifies positions with value `2` and attempts to expand regions around them.\n\n**Mistakes:**\n- The expansion logic is faulty. Instead of creating filled areas around `2`, your code draws linear paths that extend across the grid excessively.\n- Your approach assumes infinite expansion horizontally or vertically once a `2` is found. This results in incorrect paths forming across the grid instead of confined expansions around each `2`.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n**Failures Across Examples:**\n- In all provided examples, the expansion does not terminate as needed. The visual output shows behavior typical of not resetting or restraining growth which leads to incorrect grid filling.\n- The logic fails when multiple `2`s influence the grid. The expected output appears to show connected blocks or bounded growth, not long stretches of the grid being filled.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n**Improvements:**\n1. **Boundary Condition Handling:**\n   - Ensure that the growth of `1`s around each `2` is bounded by other non-zero or grid boundary conditions. Implement checks to stop growth once it reaches a boundary or another `2`.\n   \n2. **Logic for Expanding Fill:**\n   - Develop a clear rule for how areas should expand. For example, they might only need to fill up until another non-zero number or be confined to a fixed-size block. \n\n3. **Loop Over Iterations:**\n   - Consider using a more controlled algorithm, like BFS or DFS, to control how the fill spreads around each `2`.\n\n4. **Code Refactoring:**\n   - You should refactor your code for clarity and efficiency. The resetting of the column and row indices could be streamlined by preserving the original indices before entering the `while` loops, which can be confusing or error-prone if not correctly handled.\n\n### Suggestions for Revision\n\n- Revise the logic to identify how growth from `2` positions should occur geometrically. Carefully consider constraints on filling areas.\n- Use a visual or theoretical model to determine the boundary conditions for growth around each `2`.\n- Consider testing smaller sections of the algorithm independently to validate the direction of expansion.\n\nBy refining these practices in your existing code, you can better ensure that your solution matches the expected outcomes for the training and test grids."

    "feedback": "### Feedback on Your Solution\n\n#### Pattern Recognition\n\n1. **Correct Identification as Flood Fill**: You identified the need for a flood fill algorithm, trying to fill certain areas around a specific value, which likely represents areas of interest (`2` in your code).\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Output Requirements**: Your implementation fills the entire grid with `1`s, except where `2`s are already present or adjacent. However, the expected transformation does not involve filling all cells. It seems you missed the pattern of selectively transforming certain areas while leaving others unchanged.\n\n#### Edge Cases and Failures\n\n1. **Overfilling Grids**: The algorithm does not align with the expected outputs in any example shown. Instead of a selective transformation, the grid becomes almost entirely filled with `1`s. This suggests a misunderstanding of how the flood fill should be applied.\n\n2. **Handling of Value `2`**: You correctly avoid overwriting `2`s, which is part of the expected behavior, but the logic regarding when and where to initiate filling might be erroneous or incomplete.\n\n#### Code Quality and Suggestions\n\n1. **Boundary Conditions and Constraints**: The function `flood_fill` is too aggressive in filling zeros. Consider refining the conditions under which filling should occur. Make sure to understand the specific transformation that is needed, examining how areas represented by `2`s should affect adjacent areas.\n\n2. **Logical Refinement**: Review the logic to determine if specific colors or patterns trigger transformations differently. You might need additional information or rules to guide whether a cell should be filled or left unfilled.\n\n3. **Testing and Debugging**: Add print statements or use a debugger to trace how your code modifies the grid. Compare intermediate grid states against expected transformations for small examples to understand where the logic diverges.\n\n4. **Function Parameter and Scope**: Consider more descriptive function and variable names to reflect their purpose clearly. Additionally, encapsulate logic that might be reused or improved in the future.\n\nTo improve the solution, revisit both the problem description and examples to distill the rules that govern grid transformations. Understanding the rationale behind expected outputs will be key to adjusting the implementation correctly."

    "feedback": "Based on the provided visual feedback, here is a detailed analysis of your solution:\n\n### Pattern Recognition\n- **Capturing Transformation Rules**: Your code attempts to transform `0`s into `1`s when they neighbor `2`s. However, the expected output has a more complex pattern that involves filling specific shapes or expanding differently from simple adjacency.\n- **Missed Patterns**: It's evident that the algorithm does not capture patterns where filling needs to extend in specific directions or shapes beyond immediate neighbors. The actual transformations in outputs have broader context-based filling rather than just adjacent cells.\n\n### Performance on Examples\n- **Training 1**: Your prediction misses the transformation occurring at a distance, not just adjacent. It fails to connect the `2`s in meaningful ways.\n- **Training 2**: Predictions show clusters around `2`s but do not form the expected patterns, which are more structured and extend further.\n- **Training 3**: The filling process again adheres strictly to adjacency and does not capture the broader transformation required in the given output.\n- **Test Case**: The test prediction also fails to match the broader structure required, emphasizing the need for the transformation process to account for more than simple adjacency.\n\n### Code Quality and Suggestions\n1. **Pattern Logic**: Enhance the logic that determines when and how cells should be filled. Consider spatial patterns that go beyond simple adjacency checks.\n   \n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS)**: While you have used a BFS-like approach with a queue, the criteria for filling need revision. You may need to integrate additional conditions or rethink the traversal order based on the problem\u2019s requirements.\n\n3. **Function Naming & Clarity**: Consider renaming functions to more accurately reflect their role. For example, `can_fill` could convey more about pattern checks rather than adjacency.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**: Study other patterns and configurations that are missing in your attempts. It helps to generalize your transformation through more comprehensive condition checks.\n\n5. **Debugging**: Add print statements or use a debugger to step through your algorithm to understand how decisions are being made, and refine the pattern determination rules accordingly.\n\nOverall, while your current logic shows a systematic filling process, it needs to evolve to a structure-awareness logic to match the complex patterns necessary for the outputs you\u2019ve shown."

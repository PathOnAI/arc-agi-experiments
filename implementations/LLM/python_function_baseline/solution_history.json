This results in excessive filling as seen in the predictions.\n   - The transformation doesn't consider how to properly limit the propagation of `1`s based on the expected output patterns.\n\n### Failures and Edge Cases\n\n1. **Grid Boundaries**:\n   - Your code fills out-of-bound areas indiscriminately, causing entire rows and columns to be filled incorrectly.\n\n2. **Single or Isolated `2`s**:\n   - In cases where `2`s are isolated or require a specific pattern, your logic fails to replicate the expected result.\n\n3. **Intersection Management**:\n   - The repeated filling at the intersections or near other `2`s does not get handled effectively, as it inadvertently extends beyond the intended balance.\n\n### Code Quality\n\n1. **Efficiency**:\n   - Your algorithm uses nested loops, filling incrementally to the edges. For large grids, this might be computationally excessive.\n\n2. **Improvement Suggestions**:\n   - Consider determining bounds once per `2` and apply fills accordingly.\n   - Use comments to document assumptions made about each grid transformation rule.\n   - Make sure to check patterns in training examples closely to derive exact transformation logic.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **Pattern Derivation**:\n   - Derive strict bounding rules based on grid examples. Recognize valid boundaries (other cells or pattern terminations).\n\n2. **Algorithm Refinement**:\n   - Implement checks to halt the filling process properly.\n   - Use helper functions to detect and fill valid zones for increased readability and maintainability.\n\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Test the code with various edge cases and custom scenarios. Validate against expected similar patterns that appear within training data.\n\n4. **Documentation**:\n   - Ensure that any assumptions and transformations are detailed and understood before implementing the changes.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you should be able to adjust your solution to create more accurate predictions that align with the expected outputs."

This captures some of the transformation logic but appears to be incomplete.\n\n2. **Over-Extension**: The transformed grids over-extend the filling operation. Instead of only filling adjacent cells with `0` surrounding the `2`, the filling continues across the entire row and column until blocked by the grid edge or a non-zero cell.\n\n### Edge Cases\n1. **Isolated `2`s**: From the visualization, it seems the code does not handle isolated `2` cells correctly, leading to excessive filling strokes beyond nearby `0`s.\n\n2. **Multiple `2`s**: When multiple `2`s are present, the interaction between multiple fill operations is not handled well, causing overlaps and extra fills.\n\n### Code Quality & Suggestions\n1. **Fix Over-Extension**: Modify the fill function to stop filling when encountering a non-zero cell. For example, check the current grid cell value before performing the fill.\n\n2. **Conditional Logic**: Refine the logic to more closely match the intended transformation pattern seen in the expected outputs. It might involve adding conditions to respect boundaries formed by other numbers, not just `0`.\n\n3. **Test Case Handling**: Consider adding tests to capture:\n   - Grids with multiple, closely placed `2`s.\n   - Grids with isolated `2`s.\n   - Different grid shapes (non-square).\n\n4. **Efficiency**: While using numpy is efficient, ensure unnecessary operations aren\u2019t performed continuously by using logical operations to avoid excessive use of loops especially in larger grids.\n\nBy implementing these suggestions, your code would more closely match the expected transformation operations seen in the examples."

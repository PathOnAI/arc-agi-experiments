The intent to fill within this boundary is clear.\n  \n- **Incorrect Pattern Execution**: The output prediction indicates that the filling is applied across the entire bounding box defined by the '2's. This doesn't match the expected transformation output, where filling is more selective or constrained in a different shape than a simple bounding rectangle.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- **Failed Cases**: Each test case in the visualization shows that your solution predicts a full rectangle fill where it shouldn't. This suggests that the logic of simply bounding by '2's doesn't capture the transformation rule entirely.\n  \n- **Potential Issues**: Your code failed to consider the complexity of certain shapes or constraints beyond just the simple bounding box. The intended shape by the transformation might not be a straightforward fill of zeros.\n\n### Code Quality\n- **Suggestions for Improvement**:\n  1. **Explicit Condition Handling**: You need a more nuanced approach to filling. The transformation rule likely depends on a context or relationship between '2's beyond just bounding.\n  \n  2. **Handling Complex Patterns**: Consider additional conditions or state tracking for the transformation, possibly incorporating more features from the grid (e.g., connectivity, specific patterns, etc.).\n\n  3. **Testing and Validation**: Create additional test cases to validate the logic against specific scenarios and confirm your assumptions about the transformation rules.\n\n### Conclusion\nYour approach captures the initial idea of identifying '2's as boundaries but fails to represent the true complexity of the transformation task, as reflected in the visual discrepancies between the actual and predicted outputs. To improve, focus on identifying specific rules or patterns observed in the examples and adjust the logic accordingly."

This is evident in how some of the areas are filled in training examples, though not completely correct.\n  \n- **Missed Patterns**:\n  - The transformation requires more than just filling lines between `1`s. The training examples suggest additional spatial patterns, like shaped configurations that were not captured by simple line filling.\n  - Example: In `Train 1 Output`, the expected output demonstrates filled spaces under and around the initial `1`s, forming a more complex shape rather than straight lines.\n\n### Edge Cases\n- Your solution fails with complex configurations where filling should adapt beyond simple linear patterns.\n- Example: In the test case, larger connected shapes are expected, but the solution only manages basic line fills.\n\n### Code Quality\n- **Logic and Structure**:\n  - The current approach using `fill_row` is clear for the problem it's addressing, but it lacks generality for complex patterns like the test case.\n  - Consider implementing a more flexible approach that detects clusters or patterns beyond simple lines.\n\n- **Performance**:\n  - Efficient for small grids, but may struggle with larger ones due to iterative row and column scanning.\n  \n- **Improvements**:\n  - Refactor to include pattern recognition logic that can detect larger blocks or shapes rather than relying strictly on rows and columns.\n  - Investigate using algorithms suitable for spatial pattern recognition or graph-based approaches to tackle non-linear pattern filling.\n\n- **Readability**:\n  - The code is neatly structured but could be enhanced with additional inline comments explaining the logic flow and assumptions.\n\nOverall, your solution is a great attempt at solving a linear filling task but needs refinement to tackle more complex transformations suggested by the training outputs. Consider augmenting the logic to recognize and adapt to more intricate configurations."

However, analysis indicates that the pattern recognition may not align with the transformation requirements suggested by both the training and test examples.\n\n2. **Execution**:\n   - The code attempts to implement a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify enclosed areas, which is reasonable for grid traversal. However, the logic does not fully address the transformation mapped in the visualized examples.\n   - The abstraction used tends to rely on grid boundaries for enclosure checks, which may result in incorrect captures based on the example outputs.\n\n### Edge Cases:\n- The code consistently transforms entire grids into a filled state, as seen with the predictions being entirely blue (suggestive of incorrect bounding logic).\n- There is a potential oversight in not correctly identifying and excluding regions fulfilled by the example-specific transformation expectations.\n\n### Specific Failures:\n1. **Over-capturing Zero Regions**:\n   - The predictions suggest a failure to distinguish partially bounded from fully bounded regions, leading to excessive conversion.\n2. **Failure to Replicate Expected Outputs**:\n   - For each training example, the prediction does not match the expected output pattern, indicating the need for more precise boundary condition checks.\n\n### Code Quality Suggestions:\n1. **Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Refine the logic used to determine bounded regions. Consider more thorough checks that connect boundary verification with the specific patterns observed in example outputs.\n   \n2. **Condition Logic**:\n   - Examine the decision structure determining when to queue or exclude certain cells during BFS. The current setup may benefit from additional checks regarding surrounding tile configurations.\n   \n3. **Handling Edges and Corners**:\n   - Special attention should be given to grid edges and corners. The current valid check might overlook scenarios where boundary tiles play a unique role.\n   \n4. **Variable Naming and Comments**:\n   - Ensure variable names clearly explain their role, and expand comments for clarity, especially around complex conditions or transformations steps.\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n- Conduct a deeper analysis of the transformation logic tailored to the presented examples, applying tailored rule sets to identify zero regions relevant for transformation. \n- Use more targeted boundary-checking routines or methodologies to ensure that transformation actions accurately reflect the required output patterns. Experimenting with alternative traversal strategies (e.g., DFS) might uncover more effective solutions given the patterns.\n- Validate changes with a broader set of test cases to ensure adaptability of the solution beyond the provided examples. Consider creating a suite of isolated edge cases that test specific suspected failure modes for iterative adjustment.\n\nRefining these elements should align the output more closely with the intended transformation goals as demonstrated in your training and test cases."
